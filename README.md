Kraftig Audio
=============

#### The first 3D virtual audio workstation

Kraftig is a digital audio workstation, or DAW, that has a 3D first person perspective. It is a virtual studio where you can combine devices like filters and synthesizers, to create instruments, sounds, and music.

##### Getting started

To get started working on Kraftig, the easiest way is to download each of the following:

* [**NetBeans**](https://netbeans.org/): The code comes with a NetBeans project file, so this is the easiest IDE to use with Kraftig.
* [**DevilUtil**](https://github.com/SmashMaster/DevilUtil/): This library is used by Kraftig for a variety of purposes.
* [**LWJGL**](https://www.lwjgl.org/): This native library handles window creation and input handling, and is also required by DevilUtil.
